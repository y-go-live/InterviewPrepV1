Here's a [loom](https://www.loom.com/share/762fd7d12001490bbfdcf3fac37ff173?sid=9a5b2a5a-64df-4c4c-a0e7-fc9765691f81) of me explaining the app.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoloUp/FoloUp.git
```

2. Copy the existing environment template file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Clerk Setup ([Clerk](https://clerk.com/))

We use Clerk for authentication. Set up Clerk environment variables in the `.env` file. Free plan should be more than enough.

1. Navigate to [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and create an application following the [setup guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa72830-10b0-4dfd-8f07-792e7520b6a2" alt="Clerk Environment Variables" width="800">

2. Your `.env` (NOT `.env.local`) file should have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` variables populated with **no inverted commas**

3. Enable organizations in your Clerk application by navigating to the [Organization Settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings&_gl=1*58xbvk*_gcl_au*MTEzODk3NzAyMy4xNzM4NjQzMzU3*_ga*MzUyMTk4NzIwLjE3Mzg2NDM0NzY.*_ga_1WMF5X234K*MTczODczNzkxOC4zLjEuMTczODczNzkyNi4wLjAuMA..) page.

4. Make sure you create an organization and invite your email to it.

## Database Setup ([Supabase](https://supabase.com/))

Supabase is used for storing the data. It's really simple to set up and the free plan should suffice.

1. Create a project (Note down your project's password)
2. Got to SQL Editor and copy the SQL code from `supabase_schema.sql`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31c14b8-45ca-417c-8927-aceb36fa5990" alt="Supabase SQL Editor" height="200">

3. Run the SQL code to confirm the tables are created.
4. Copy the supabase url and anon key from the project settings and paste it in the `.env` file in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Retell AI Setup ([Retell AI](https://retell.ai/))

We use Retell AI to manage all the voice calls. They manage storage of recordings and provide a simple SDK to integrate with. They provide free credits to start with and will have to pay as you go.

1. Create an API key from [Retell AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.retellai.com/apiKey) and add it to the `.env` file in `RETELL_API_KEY`

## Add OpenAI API Key

We use OpenAI to generate questions for interviews and analyze responses. This would not be that costly.

1. Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key
2. Add the API key to the `.env` file in `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Getting Started locally

First install the packages:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Self Hosting

We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the app.
